Dadras et al. \cite{DGRS15} study behavior of a vehicle platoon in an adversarial environment. They consider insider attack where an adversary has control of a vehicle of the platoon and whose derivative controller gain it can modify to destabilize or take control of the entire platoon. In the considered platoon, predecessor and follower vehicles distance and velocity information are used by a vehicle to compute its velocity and acceleration. The attack considered in the paper is feasible at every position of the platoon.

% \item Controllability of platoon by a vehicle at different position and if platoon is controllable by the vehicle then
