Dadras et al. \cite{DGRS15} study behavior of a vehicle platoon in an adversarial environment. They consider insider attack where an adversary has control of a vehicle of the platoon and whose derivative controller gain it can modify to destabilize or take control of the entire platoon. In the considered platoon, predecessor and follower vehicles distance and velocity information are used by a vehicle to compute its velocity and acceleration. The attack considered in the paper is feasible at every position of the platoon. 
%\begin{itemize}
% \item Questions and observations made in the paper
% \item Under adversarial environment stability and string stability are not same
% \item Controllability of platoon by an attacker vehicle at different position: a platoon is controllable by the attacker controlled vehicle only if it has full ranked controllability matrix and the uncontrollable states can be computed by performing similarity comparison.  
%\item The derivative gain of the controller should be within a range of values to cause instability of string
%\item Find the necessary and maximum value of attacker gain to cause instability of platoon ?
%\item Find the control input fequency that will destabilize the platoon?
%\item The platoon can be made asymptotically and BIBO unstable by making real part of single eigenvalue of matrix A > 0. 
%\item The platoon can be made to collapse at one target vehicle by attacking multiple vehicle of the platoon
%\end{itemize}

Sajjad et al. \cite{SSDSG15} have designed an adversarial aware sliding mode control scheme that uses only local sensor data and a decentralized attack detector to reduce the number and severity of collision from an attacker controlled vehicle of a platoon. Their solution makes the assumption that the bidirectional platoon is homogeneous with all cars sharing the same control law. They consider a single attacker that modifies the control law of a vehicle to induce an oscillatory behavior in the platoon. While preserving safety of the platoon, the method led to compromise of string stability.     
%  They start the attack when platoon is in steady state. Size of the platoon is known and the controller gains are tuned according to it
